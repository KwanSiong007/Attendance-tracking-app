# Attendance Tracker

_Attendance Tracker_ is a full-stack web app for workers to check in and out at worksites. It uses geolocation to confirm that workers are at a worksite, and includes an attendance dashboard for managers. This app was built by [Kwan Siong](https://github.com/KwanSiong007) and [Cheng Wai](https://github.com/chengwaikoo) as [Project 2](https://bootcamp.rocketacademy.co/2-full-stack/2.p-full-stack-app-firebase) for the [Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp](https://www.rocketacademy.co/courses/coding-bootcamp).
